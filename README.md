# Module 3
## Lesson 1: Playground
In this Lesson I learnt how to run questions as prompts and select different prompt templates.
I also understood how to provide the model follow-up questions along with giving the model directives to assume the personality of a different type of person,(eg. A pirate from the 1600s)
I figured out how to change the parameters like temperature and the provider and how to save the different configurations. Different providers have difference response times and token usage per prompt generation. I also learnt that it is possible to compare the outputs and performances of different providers. I also understood how to use output schema to format the outputs to the prompts we give. The final thing I understood is that the playground can be used to iterate LLM inputs and how to run experiments over datasets in the playground.
