# Intro to Langgraph
# Module 3

## Lesson 1
In this lesson, I learned how streaming in LangGraph allows me to see real-time updates as a graph runs. I discovered how to use stream functions to get outputs as they are generated instead of waiting for the final result. I also learned about different stream modes that control what kind of data is shown. Overall, I understood how streaming improves interactivity and clarity in workflows.

## Lesson 2
In this lesson, I learned how to use breakpoints in LangGraph to pause a graphâ€™s execution at specific points. I discovered that this allows me to inspect the state or get user input before continuing. I also learned the difference between static and dynamic breakpoints. Overall, I understood how breakpoints give more control and flexibility during workflow execution.

## Lesson 3
In this lesson, I learned how to pause a graph and edit its internal state based on human feedback. I discovered how to use the interrupt function to stop execution, make corrections or adjustments, and then resume the workflow. I also understood how this approach allows humans to guide model behavior and improve accuracy during execution.

## Lesson 4
In this lesson, I learned how to use dynamic breakpoints in LangGraph to pause a workflow based on conditions that occur during execution. I discovered that breakpoints can be triggered when specific criteria are met, allowing inspection or editing of the state before continuing. I also understood how this makes workflows more adaptable and allows better handling of complex or unpredictable situations.

## Lesson 5
In this lesson, I learned how to use the time travel feature in LangGraph to revisit and modify past execution states. I discovered that I can access previous checkpoints, update the state if needed, and resume the graph from that point to explore alternate outcomes. I also understood how this feature is useful for debugging, testing different scenarios, and analyzing workflow decisions.
